Python packages: BeatifulSoup and Requests

from bs4 import BeatifulSoup
import requests

then get the Url
url = (...)
page = requests.get(url) # this the function that get the content and outputs a response object

# if the response is 200 is okay 
# the other are possible errors: invalid/empty

# think about scraping as taking a snapshot of the html page, cause actually in a page there is dynamic content, but what i download is a snapshot!
#page.text is the raw html
soup = BeatifulSoup(page.text,'html') # specifying i want to parse the information in a html format
# everythin is here!
print(soup.pretify()) # to see the content, actually, pretify() visualize in a better way the content

soup.find('div') / soup.find_all('div')
# what's the difference?
#soup.find() gives the first div tag of the page
#soup.find_all() gives all the div tags of the page, a list of them
# how can i specify for one of them? i can use the attributes (eg. class, a, href, id, ...)
soup.find_all('div', class_ = 'col-md-12')
# this still returns a list because there are many possile tag with same attributes
