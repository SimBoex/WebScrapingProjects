Python packages: BeatifulSoup and Requests

from bs4 import BeatifulSoup
import requests

then get the Url
url = (...)
page = requests.get(url) # this the function that get the content and outputs a response object

# if the response is 200 is okay 
# the other are possible errors: invalid/empty

# think about scraping as taking a snapshot of the html page, cause actually in a page there is dynamic content, but what i download is a snapshot!
#page.text is the raw html
soup = BeatifulSoup(page.text,'html') # specifying i want to parse the information in a html format
# everythin is here!
print(soup.pretify()) # to see the content, actually, pretify() visualize in a better way the content

soup.find('div') / soup.find_all('div')
# what's the difference?
#soup.find() gives the first div tag of the page
#soup.find_all() gives all the div tags of the page, a list of them
# how can i specify for one of them? i can use the attributes (eg. class, a, href, id, ...)
soup.find_all('div', class_ = 'col-md-12')
# this still returns a list because there are many possile tag with same attributes

# i can do the same for the p tag obviously
soup.find_all('p', class_ = 'lead').
# now let's say i want to extract the text, can i use the attribute .text with .find_all()? no i can't
# the general idea is: i use find_all() before i need to extract the text with the method .text(), to do so i need to change to .find()
# obviosly i can use all the string methods on it after extracting the text

#let's try a more complex scraping, then get the data and put in a pandas dataframe
url = '...'
page = requests.get(url)
soup = BeatifulSoup(page.text,'html')
table = soup.find_all('table')[1]
# in this case as i said i can achieve the same using soup.find() since is the first occurance
# now i want to get the headers this can be done easily usign the th tag since this is a quite unique tag
world_titles = table.find_all('th') #using the found table
#now since i want only the text for each tag i need to iterate
world_table_titles = [title.text.strip() for title in world_titles]

# now i want to create a dataframe
df = pd.DataFrame(columns = world_table_titles)


# and i can do the same for 'tr' (looking for rows)
column_data = table.find_all('tr)
# and then iterate looking for the td tag
for row in column_data[1:]:
  row_data = row.find_all('td')
  individual_row_data = [title.text.strip() for data in row_data]
  # i can put a row at the time in the new dataframe
  length = len(df)
  df.loc[length] = individual_row_data
  # what's the difference  between loc and iloc?

# i have my table!

df.to_csv(path/nameFile.csv)
